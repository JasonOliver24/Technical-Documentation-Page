            <header>What is the LIMA technique?</header>
            <p>LIMA describes a trainer or behavior consultant who uses the least intrusive, minimally aversive strategy
                out of a set of humane and effective tactics likely to succeed in achieving a training or behavior
                change objective. LIMA adherence also requires consultants to be adequately educated and skilled in
                order to ensure that the least intrusive and aversive procedure is used. [1]
            </p>
            <pre>
    <code>LIMA does not justify the use of punishment in lieu of other effective interventions and strategies.</code>
</pre>
            <p>In the vast majority of cases, desired behavior change can be affected by focusing on the animal's
                environment, physical well-being, and operant and classical interventions such as differential
                reinforcement of an alternative behavior, desensitization, and counterconditioning.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="LIMA_Is_Competence-Based">
            <header>LIMA Is Competence-Based</header>
            <p>LIMA requires trainers/consultants to work to increase the use of positive reinforcement and eliminate
                the use of punishment when working with animal and human clients. In order to ensure best practices,
                consultants should pursue and maintain competence in animal behavior consulting and training through
                continuing education, and hands-on experience.</p>
            <pre>
                    <code>Trainers/consultants should not advise on problems outside the recognized boundaries of their competencies and
experience. [2]</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Positive_Reinforcement_and_Understanding_the_Learner">
            <header>Positive Reinforcement and Understanding the Learner</header>
            <p>Positive reinforcement should be the first line of teaching, training, and behavior change program
                considered, and should be
                applied consistently.</p>
            <pre>
    <code>Positive reinforcement is associated with the lowest incidence of aggression, attention seeking, avoidance, and fear in learners. [3]</code>
</pre>
            <p>Only the learner determines what may be reinforcing. It is crucial that the trainer/consultant
                understands and has the ability to appropriately apply this principle. This fact may mean that the
                trainer/consultant assesses any handling, petting, food, tool, and environment each time the learner
                experiences them. Personal bias must not determine the learner’s experience.
                The measure of each stimulus is whether the learner’s target behavior is strengthening or weakening, not
                the
                trainer/consultant’s intent or preference.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Systematic_Problem_Solving_and_Strategies">
            <header>Systematic Problem Solving and Strategies</header>
            <p>The trainer/consultant is responsible for ensuring learner success through a consistent, systematic
                approach that identifies a
                specific target behavior, the purpose of that behavior, and the consequences that maintain the behavior.
            </p>
            <p>A variety of learning and behavior change strategies may come into play during a case. Ethical use of
                this variety always depends on the trainer/consultant’s ability to adequately problem solve and to
                understand the impact of each action on the learner, as well as sensitivity toward the learner’s
                experience.

        <section class="main-section" id="Preventing_Abuse">
            <header>Preventing Abuse</header>
            <p>We seek to prevent the abuses and potential repercussions of inappropriate, poorly applied, and inhumane
                uses of punishment and of overly-restrictive management and confinement strategies. The potential
                effects of punishment can
                include aggression or counter-aggression; suppressed behavior (preventing the trainer/consultant from
                adequately reading the animal); increased anxiety and fear; physical harm; a negative association with
                the owner or handler; increased unwanted behavior; and, new, unwanted behaviors. [5]

        <section class="main-section" id="Choice_and_Control_for_the_Learner">
            <header>Choice and Control for the Learner</header>
            <p>LIMA guidelines require that trainer/consultants always offer the learner as much control and choice as
                possible.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>Trainer/consultants must treat each individual of any species with respect and awareness of the learner’s individual nature, preferences, abilities, and needs. [6]</code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="What_Do_You_Want_the_Animal_To_Do?">
            <header>What Do You Want the Animal To Do?</header>
            <p>We focus on reinforcing desired behaviors, and always ask the question, </p>
            <pre>
                    <code>“What do you want the animal to do?”</code>
                </pre>
            <p>Relying on punishment in training does not answer this question, and therefore offers no acceptable
                behavior for the animal to learn to replace the unwanted behavior. These LIMA guidelines do not justify
                the use of aversive methods and tools including, but not limited to, the use of electronic, choke or
                prong collars in lieu of other effective positive reinforcement interventions and strategies.
            </p>
            <p>When making training and behavior modification decisions, trainers/consultants should understand and
                follow the Humane Hierarchy of Behavior Change – Procedures for Humane and Effective Practices, [7]
            </p>
            <p>For these reasons, we, strongly support the humane and thoughtful application of LIMA protocols, and we
                applaud those individuals and organizations working with animals and humans within LIMA guidelines.

            <p>The Humane Hierarchy serves to guide professionals in their decision-making process during training and
                behavior modification. Additionally, it assists owners and animal care professionals in understanding
                the standard of care to be applied in determining training practices and methodologies and the order of
                implementation for applying those training practices and methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>Hierarchy of Procedures for Humane and Effective Practice</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Health, nutritional, and physical factors: Ensure that any indicators for possible medical,
                    nutritional, or health factors are addressed by a licensed veterinarian. The consultant should also
                    address potential factors in the
                    physical environment.</li>
                <li>Antecedents: Redesign setting events, change motivations, and add or remove discriminative stimuli
                    (cues) for the problem behavior</li>
                <li>Positive Reinforcement: Employ approaches that contingently deliver a consequence to increase the
                    probability
                    that the desired behavior will occur.</li>
                <li>Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior: Reinforce an acceptable replacement behavior and
                    remove the maintaining reinforcer for the problem behavior</li>
                <li>Negative Punishment, Negative Reinforcement, or Extinction (these are not listed in any order of
                    preference):
                    <p>a) Negative Punishment– Contingently withdraw a positive reinforcer to reduce the probability
                        that the problem behavior will occur.</p>
                    <p>b) Negative Reinforcement– Contingently withdraw an aversive antecedent stimulus to increase the
                        probability that the right behavior will occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>c) Extinction – Permanently remove the maintaining reinforcer to suppress the behavior or reduce
                        it to
                        baseline levels.</p>
                <li>Positive Punishment: Contingently deliver an aversive consequence to reduce the probability that the
                    problem
                    behavior will occur.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="end">*Intrusiveness refers to the degree to which the learner has counter control. The goal is to
                use the procedure
                that is the least intrusive, effective alternative. In the course of an experienced behavior
                consultant’s practice,
                there may be situations in which a relatively more intrusive procedure is necessary for effective
                outcomes. In
                this case, a procedure that reduces the learner’s control may be the least intrusive, effective
                alternative.
                Wellness is at the top of the hierarchy to ensure that a learning solution is not implemented for
                behavior
                problems due to pain or illness. The hierarchy is a cautionary tool to reduce both dogmatic rule
                following and
                practice by familiarity or convenience. It offers an ethical checkpoint for consultants to carefully
                consider the
                process by which effective outcomes can be most humanely achieved on a case-by-case basis. Rationale
                like,
                “It worked with the last case!” is not enough. The evaluation and behavior change program of every
                animal
                should be a study of the individual (i.e., individual animal, setting, caregiver, etc.). Changing
                behavior is best
                understood as a study of one.</p>
